    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Logistic distribution.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import logistic from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-logistic@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-logistic/tags). For example,

```javascript
import logistic from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-logistic@v0.2.2-esm/index.mjs';
```

You can also import the following named exports from the package:

```javascript
import { Logistic, cdf, entropy, kurtosis, logcdf, logpdf, mean, median, mgf, mode, pdf, quantile, skewness, stdev, variance } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-logistic@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### logistic

Logistic distribution.

```javascript
var dist = logistic;
// returns {...}
```

The namespace contains the following distribution functions:

<!-- <toc pattern="*+(cdf|pdf|mgf|quantile)*"> -->

<div class="namespace-toc">

-   <span class="signature">[`cdf( x, mu, s )`][@stdlib/stats/base/dists/logistic/cdf]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">logistic distribution cumulative distribution function.</span>

The namespace contains the following functions for calculating distribution properties:

</div>

<!-- </toc> -->

The namespace contains a constructor function for creating a [logistic][logistic-distribution] distribution object.

<!-- <toc pattern="*ctor*"> -->

<div class="namespace-toc">

-   <span class="signature">[`Logistic( [mu, s] )`][@stdlib/stats/base/dists/logistic/ctor]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">logistic distribution constructor.</span>

</div>

<!-- </toc> -->

```javascript
var Logistic = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-logistic' ).Logistic;

var dist = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var y = dist.pdf( 2.0 );
// returns 0.0625
